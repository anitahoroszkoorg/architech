# Architech application for filling out forms

<<<<<<< HEAD
I designed this project in Figma for a company that needed better UX for their application process for potential contractors. I've created a more user friendly layout for filling out complicated forms. I've decided to develop it myself in **React** with **Typescript** using tools such as **Material UI** and **Formik** as well as **custom React Hooks** for fetching data.The application communicates with backend (created by a backend developer) written in FastAPI and uses Postgres database. For testing my application I wrote end-to-end tests in **Cypress** to check for any glitches and make sure the app runs smoothly.</br><img width = "400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/193845856-bec46da0-3ba3-4ec3-b5ce-c3f00d54b439.png"> <img width = "400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/193865473-bd3074fd-9571-4d73-bb0c-074670bfa687.png">
