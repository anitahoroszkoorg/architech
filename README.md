# Architech application for filling out forms

I designed this project in Figma for a company that needed better UX for their application process for potential contractors. I've created a more user friendly layout for filling out complicated forms. I've decided to develop it myself in React with Typescript using tools such as Material UI and Formik as well as custom React Hooks for fetching data. The application comunicates with backend (created by other developer) written in FastAPI and uses Postgres database. </br><img width = "400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/193845856-bec46da0-3ba3-4ec3-b5ce-c3f00d54b439.png"> <img width = "400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95635795/193865473-bd3074fd-9571-4d73-bb0c-074670bfa687.png">
